Student_info elements are: std::string, std::vector, and double.
The class variables copied, assigned and destructed by their own copy 
constructor, assignment constructor, and destructor.
The double is value initialized to 0.0 and default "uninitialized". 
The doubles are assigned and copied by their values. There is no deconstructor 
for build-in types, so only 2 members (the name and the homework vector) are 
destroyed by the synthesized destructor.
